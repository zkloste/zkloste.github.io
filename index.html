           <h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1>
            <p id="abtP" class="descText">As an avid whitewater kayaker, mountain biker, and adventurer, my core values are in the preservation and sustainability of America’s wild and wonderful places. These values have guided me to use my engineering experience for the betterment of our communities through sustainable and long lasting solutions. From developing software for assembly lines that assemble electric trucks to designing a hydroponics system to calculate the cost of indoor grown soy, I have been mindfully selective with the projects I spend large amounts of time and resources on. It is my long term goal to be a part of a company that is closely aligned to my interests in preserving and adding resiliency to America’s ecosystems.</p>

                <p class="descText">With experience from my previous co-op rotations, I was quickly given responsibilities equal to an entry level Controls Engineer. Some of these responsibilities included updating BOM’s for machine retools and working with the purchasing department to get all necessary components for assembly. I also developed 2D vision systems for robotic applications and wrote robust PLC logic modules that could be scaled up and used for numerous stations on an assembly line. To support the startup of these assembly lines, I traveled to the customer’s facility for several weeks at a time where I debugged equipment and trained the customer’s engineers on the turnkey machines we provided.</p>

                <p class="descText">For my first few co-ops I learned the ropes of Controls and Automation Engineering at Coldwater Machine Company. I built on the introductory robotics, PLC, and programming skills I had learned in high school and was able to quickly become a valuable member of the engineering team. I was responsible for creating AutoCAD schematic packages for robotic cells, coordinating with panel builders in order to get control panels in time for the scheduled power-up, and assisted engineers in the debug of turnkey automated solutions. By my last co-op rotation, I was traveling to customers sites to assist in retooling equipment on a tight automotive supplier schedule.</p>
