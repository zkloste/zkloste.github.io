           <h1 id="abtH">About Me</h1>
            <p id="abtP">As an avid whitewater kayaker, mountain biker, and adventurer, my core values are in the preservation and sustainability of America’s wild and wonderful places. These values have guided me to use my engineering experience for the betterment of our communities through sustainable and long lasting solutions. From developing software for assembly lines that assemble electric trucks to designing a hydroponics system to calculate the cost of indoor grown soy, I have been mindfully selective with the projects I spend large amounts of time and resources on. It is my long term goal to be a part of a company that is closely aligned to my interests in preserving and adding resiliency to America’s ecosystems.</p>
